# AnagramCheck

AnagramCheck is a simple iOS app written in Swift which allows the user to check if a word is an anagram. If the word is an anagram, the app will display all the valid anagrams of the user input.

I am in the process of polishing the app; it is not a finished project. It has basic functionality, but still has some aspects which need to be refined.
