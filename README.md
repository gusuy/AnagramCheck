# AnagramCheck

AnagramCheck is a simple iOS app written in Swift which allows the user to check if a word is an anagram. If the word is an anagram, the app will display all the valid anagrams of the entered word.

I am in the process of polishing the app; it is not a finished project. It has basic functionality, but still has many aspects which need to be refined and minor issues which need to be fixed.
