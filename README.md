# AnagramCheck

AnagramCheck is a simple iOS app written in Swift which allows the user to check if a word is an anagram. If the word is an anagram, the app will display all the valid anagrams of the user input.

I am in the process of polishing this app. It works, but there are some aspects that need to be refined and features I would like to add.
